TODO: pretty much everything

This will be a classic multiplayer game of chess written with nodejs using sockets

## THE SERVER

The server will pair two players in one instance of the game
during an instance the server shall follow the folowing main loop:
1. Recive a movement command from the current player
2. Check if the command is valid given the current state (the bulk of the logic)
a) if its not send a message to the player that the command was rejected and do nothing
b) if the command is valid, send it to both players and update the state
3. Give the turn to the next player

Internally the table should be kept as a two dimensional array of integers, where 0 denotes an empty space and every chess piece corresponds to 
a certian number (e.g white pawns can be 1, white king 2 etc...)

## THE PROTOCOL
# CLIENT->SERVER
From client to server it should be a string of size 4 that describes from where to where in classic chess fashion
When a clients aborts the game it should send a message "EXIT"
Further messages may need to be added in the future, but if possible they should all be 4 bytes
The messages of a client who is not on turn should be ignored (unless its a exit message)
# SERVER->CLIENT
From server to client: on connection the client should recieve a two dimensional array with the initial state of the board
Beforehand it would be a good idea to send the dimensions of the actual board, as this would allow to modify the server to support more exotic chess rules
without having to modify the client much/at all
The server should send a message with the last move to both players on every update of the table state
When a server rejects a movement from the client it should send back a message "REJC" (ideally keep it 4 bytes)

## THE CLIENT
dunno lol
it draws a board based on the first message from the server
it allows the user to drag and drop or click and click on figures and translates that to a message to send to the server
it redraws the board when the server sends an update

ALL OF THE ABOVE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE
